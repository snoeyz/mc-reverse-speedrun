Turns the typical Minecraft speedrun on it's head!

## Features

### Start in The End!
The speedrun begins in The End dimension where you have to fight the dragon! It's recommended you turn on the bonus chest to give yourself a fighting chance against her!

### Fight Your Way to a Nether Portal!
Fight your way through the Nether, collecting gold and blaze rods to make enough Eyes of Ender to finish the Nether Fortress portal!

### Bring it Back Home!
Once you make it to the overworld, challenge yourself further by making it all the way back to 0,0!


#### Known Bugs
- Changing the world type from Default will mess everything up
- Manually placing a nether portal will look scuffed if it's facing the wrong direction (the one that generates from you traveling through the fortress portal is coded to face the correct way to not look scuffed
- Going back through the nether portal from the "overworld" will send you to the "end" not back to the fortress portal room
- Breaking any part of a nether portal frame does not cause the portal to break
